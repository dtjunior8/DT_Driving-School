    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p>Here's what some of our student learners have said about David.</p>

    <p>"And then from me personally, I want to thank you again for all your patience, kindness, understanding and excellent coaching to make sure I passed my behind the wheel test yesterday.   As I told you yesterday, I really lucked out...you as my driving teacher.
Your upbeat, positive  outlook, delightful personality  , amazing teaching skills gave me the confidence I needed to pass my test.!"</p>

<p>- Marsha N.</p>

<p>"David Tam is an excellent driving teacher! He is patient and provides clear guidance. I feel significantly more comfortable after just two sessions."</p>

<p>- Molly S.</p>

<p>"Our amazing instructor, David, is super calm and offers excellent coaching. Using a lesson plan that clearly works, he very gently dropped our daughter "into the deep end" of driving! Before we knew it, our daughter had driven us 20 miles from home using surface streets and was ready and confident enough to merge onto Highway 92 and then the 101! Yes... that was on her first lesson! Simply amazing!"</p>

<p>- Trebor S.</p>

<p>"My son had his first of three classes yesterday. David is a great instructor  -has was very patient and calm, gave many opporunities to try different skills, was very thorough, and provided enough challenging situations to make it interesting and worthwhile. I appreciated being in the car - it was a good way to start getting more comfortable with my son behind the wheel, and I could hear first hand what he learned. I would definitely recommend."</p>

<p>- K A.</p>

<p>"We had a great experience. The driving instructor David was so patient and explained things to the kids really well(I have twins). For the first driving class I was surprised that they went on main roads and thorough fair. I was so glad I was in the car so now I know what their weaknesses are and what we need to work on when they are driving with me."</p>
